MSTAR Tensorflow

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition is an important problem for automatic target recognition and aerial reconnaissance in military applications. We propose to use a deep convolutional neural network to classify and extract useful features of target chips taken from SAR image scenes. We will use the publically available Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) database as our dataset to evaluate our network.
